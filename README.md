# 'Ping A Freelancer'

<img src="https://freelanceme.blob.core.windows.net/container1/55579_Ping.png" align="center" />

### A .NET Blazor WebAssembly single-page app. A one-stop shop to your neighborhood's handymen, technicians, and craftsmen.

â€˜Ping A Freelancerâ€™ is a SaaS marketplace that connects freelancers who provide in-home services to clients that need things done, potentially within the hour. Be it a painter, a nanny, a tutor, a furniture assembler, or a chiropractor. This eliminates intermediaries and ramps up response times, providing flexibility at an affordable rate.

The modern and simplistic UIâ€™s body is wrapped from all four sides within an iPhone container, demonstrating what Iâ€™ve envisioned for the final prototype. The ultimate goal is to transition to a .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid app. Offline capabilties would essentially give users a phonebook of freelancers to contact despite not being able to interact live. This would also leverage push notifications and alerts. Only the frontend architecture would need patching. 

## Typical scenario
Assume that Dana AlQahtani is planning her daughter's engagement party and would like the services of a photographer and a hairstylist, but hasn't made arrangements, and it's getting quite late to do so. She decides to start up Ping A Freelancer to browse its freelancers.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>She registers with her details for a new account.
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
She is welcomed with an array of domains to choose from. Each of which houses a number of freelancers with different expertises. There are a total of 52 expertises scaterred across seven domains. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
You'll find furniture assemblers and chauffeurs, for example, under Manual Labor. 
<br/><br/>
And housekeepers, errand runners, and in-home chefs under Domestic Services.
<br/><br/>
You'll find chiropractors, yoga instructors, and personal trainers under Health & Wellness.
<br/><br/>
And interior designers, tutors, and stylists under Business Services.
<br/><br/>
Router technicians and electrical appliance repairerrs are under Home Tech.
<br/><br/>
And finally, pet sitters and pet groomers are under Pet Care.


<br/><br/>Dana finds a photographer under Business Services. He's Meshal AlFahad. So, one down, one to go.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>And a stylist. Ghada AlSubaie. Great.<br/><br/>
<img src="https://freelanceme.blob.core.windows.net/container1/ghada.png" align="center" width="300" />
<br/><br/>Dana views Ghada's profile and taps on 'Ping Me' in order to start the conversation. She also pings Meshal. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>The ball is now in the freelancer's court, and it's up to Ghada to decide whether or not to start a contract. Ghada sees the long transit time, which may be an issue, and so she can always give client Dana a call to discuss further. At this point, if Dana is pressed for time, it is in her best interest to ping a number of different freelancers under the same expertise to increase the chances for a match.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>The hours required is agreed between the two parties. As shown, is in the client's hands to end the contract with 'End contract' as long as all matters have come to an end. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>Dana also has the ability to rate, a tool for transparency and integrity which the other members of the app can benefit from. Note that Ghada's IsActive boolean currently points to the fact that she is actively working with clients and is employable, but I'd like to change its meaning to whether she is enrolled in an active contract, and therefore is busy.<br/><br/>

I was thrilled to develop an app envisioned at a much earlier time during my academic career, one which mapped to a real world scenario that I believed needed solving. The appâ€™s development remained exciting, especially  with a deadline, as I used it during my Senior Design Project. My plan is to continue with the app's development by porting it to MAUI Blazor Hybrid, a technology that fuses Blazor with .NET MAUI and enables mobile functionality, cross-platform. That will allow for notifications, tabbed navigation from page to page, and live location services
