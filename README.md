# 'Ping A Freelancer'

### A .NET Blazor WebAssembly single-page app, and a one-stop shop to your neighborhood's handymen, technicians, and craftsmen

This GitHub page showcases a SaaS marketplace Iâ€™ve been developing, â€˜Ping A Freelancerâ€™, that connects freelancers who provide in-home services to clients that need things done, potentially within the hour. Be it a painter, a nanny, a tutor, a furniture assembler, or a chiropractor. This eliminates intermediaries and ramps up response times, providing flexibility at an affordable rate.

Though a fully functional web app, the ultimate goal is to transition to a .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid app would provide offline capabilities, essentially giving users a phonebook of freelancers to contact despite not being able to interact. The app would also leverage push notifications and alerts. The following examples wrap the app content with the chassis of an iPhone, in order to display the final product that I am envisioning.

## Typical scenario
Assume that Dana AlQahtani is planning her daughter's engagement party and would like the services of a photographer and a hairstylist, but hasn't made arrangements, and it's getting quite late. She decides to open Ping A Freelancer to browse its freelancers.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>She registers with her details for a new account.
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
She is welcomed with an array of domains to choose from. Each of which house a number of freelancers with different expertises. From furniture assemblers, to housekeepers...

<br/><br/>to chiropractors, to interior designers, to WiFi technicians...<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>to pet sitters, to music teachers, all offering in-home services.<br/><br/>
<img src="https://freelanceme.blob.core.windows.net/container1/domains3.png" align="center" width="300" />
<br/><br/>She finds a photographer under Business Services. He's Meshal AlFahad. So, one down, one to go.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>And a stylist. Ghada AlSubaie. Great.<br/><br/>
<img src="https://freelanceme.blob.core.windows.net/container1/ghada.png" align="center" width="300" />
<br/><br/>Dana views Ghada's profile and taps on 'Ping Me' in order to start the conversation.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>The ball is now in Ghada's court, and it's up to her whether or not to start the contract. The long transit time may be an issue, and so she can always give the client a call to discuss further. At this point, if Dana's pressed for time, it is in her best interest to ping a number of freelancers to increase the chance for a match.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>The hours spent and the amount paid are agreed between the two parties. It is in the client's hands to end the contract as long as all matters have come to an end. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>But Dana also has the ability to rate, a tool for transparency which the other members of the app can benefit from.<br/><br/>
