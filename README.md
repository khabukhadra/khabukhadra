# 'Ping A Freelancer'
### A .NET Blazor WebAssembly single-page app, and a one-stop shop to your neighborhood's handymen, technicians, and craftsmen

This GitHub page showcases a SaaS marketplace Iâ€™ve been developing, â€˜Ping A Freelancerâ€™, that connects freelancers who provide in-home services to clients that need things done, potentially within the hour. Be it a painter, a nanny, a tutor, a furniture assembler, or a chiropractor. This eliminates intermediaries and ramps up response times, providing flexibility at an affordable rate.


Though a fully functional web app, the ultimate goal is to transition to a .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid app would provide offline capabilities, essentially giving users a phonebook of freelancers to contact despite not being able to interact. The app would also leverage push notifications and alerts. The following examples wrap the app content with the chassis of an iPhone, in order to display the final product that I am envisioning.
